Our estimation was as follows:

29.5 hours total
12.5 hrs for learning python/pygame (2.5 hrs/person)
3 hrs for design
15 hours coding (3 hrs/person)
4 hours putting code together and hashing out bugs

I, Jake, made the estimation near the start of the project because I had the 
experience in pygame that led us to choose the language. I chose it because I 
was confident in a tutorial that would help everyone get up to speed quickly 
and then we could use python in a way that would create a nice user interface
(compared to the command line). The tutorial was about 2
